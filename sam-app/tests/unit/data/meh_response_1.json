            "body": "It's a dark irony. You can't sleep at night because you're searching for a good night's sleep. You literally can't rest until you've tracked down those excellent pillows from your last hotel stay. Gentle yet firm. Soft yet supportive. You want those pillows. You *need* those pillows.\r\n\r\nThe tags on the pillows was no help about where to buy more: not so much as a web URL. The cleaning lady just rolled her eyes at you. After much irritable sighing, the front desk eventually tracked down a phone number for Jeff at the hotel procurement office. \r\n\r\nJeff's voicemail greeting said he'll be on vacation all summer, but you can call Rachel. You took a day off work to call Rachel, leaving increasingly desperate pleas for those pillows. Somehow you missed her one call back: that she really works better over email.\r\n\r\nShe still hasn't answered your email. You can't go on living this way. But you can't go on living without *those pillows*.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be like this. There is a way out. These shredded memory foam pillows offer hotel-style comfort and a hypoallergenic bamboo rayon cover, all with a legitimate provenance. If you buy three pairs, you can be set for years to come, for less than the cost of a one-night stay in the crappiest motel. Not to mention the emotional cost of waiting for an email that never comes."
